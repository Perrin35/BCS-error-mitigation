The current Github repository is composed of two parts: a part which contains the jupyter notebooks and generates the different circuits needed for the simulations and the error mitigation protocols (e.g. "file_name".ipynb) as well as some files where functions are defined and used in notebooks(e.g. "functions_file.py"). 
It can take time to generate all the circuits, therefore, the second part in the folder data contains the different circuits generated by these notebooks. Notebooks also called these circuits, needed either for building extra circuits of top of them (randomized compiling and noise estimation circuits) or for analysing the results. In the folder data, results of the quantum computer can also be found which will be used in post-analysis notebooks.

Details where to find the location of circuits are explained in the corresponding notebook which generate them.
